<p> These kofta kebabs are made with ground lamb and have 6 different kinds of spices. They are very good!</p>

<h2> INGREDİENTS</h2>
<ul>
    <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt </li>
    <li>1 pound ground lamb </li>
    <li>3 tablespoons grated onion </li>
    <li>¼ 3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley </li>
    <li> 1 tablespoon ground coriander</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin  </li>
    <li>½ tablespoon ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon ground allspice</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
</ul>

<h2> STEPS </h2>
<ol>
    <li>Mash garlic into a paste with salt using a mortar and pestle or the flat side of a chef's knife on your cutting board. Mix garlic into lamb with onion, parsley, coriander, cumin, cinnamon, allspice, cayenne pepper, ginger, and pepper in a mixing bowl until well blended. Form mixture into 28 balls. Form each ball around the tip of a skewer, flattening it into a 2-inch oval; repeat with remaining skewers. Place kebabs onto a baking sheet, cover, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 12 hours.</li>
    <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
    <li>Cook skewers on the preheated grill, turning occasionally, until browned and cooked through, about 5 to 6 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a kebab should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).  </li>
